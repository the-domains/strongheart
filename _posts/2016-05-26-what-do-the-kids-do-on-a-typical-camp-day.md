**What do the kids do on a typical camp day?**

The kids have between 3-4 formal martial arts classes as well as learning valuable skills such as anti-bullying, anger management, leadership skills, and community service. They also do art lessons, and go outdoors to parks everyday. Every Friday we end the week with a big celebration and party. The camps are very structured, and a lot of fun. Parents tell us they love that their kids are happy, and very tired. A great way to get a introduction to martial arts or to get a leg up on your current martial arts training.
